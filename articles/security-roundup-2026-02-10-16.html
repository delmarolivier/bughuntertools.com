                <p><strong>This week delivered a masterclass in modern vulnerability patterns:</strong> three critical CVEs targeting AI infrastructure (vLLM, n8n, Azure Functions), a sophisticated AI-assisted AWS breach completed in under 10 minutes, and Microsoft patching 61 vulnerabilities including multiple cloud service exposures.</p>
                
                <p>If you're bug hunting in 2026, the message is clear: <strong>AI infrastructure and serverless platforms are the new gold rush.</strong> Organizations are deploying LLM servers, workflow automation, and cloud functions at breakneck speed—often with security as an afterthought.</p>
            </div>

            <section id="breaking-news">
                <h2>🔥 Breaking News: Three Critical RCEs This Week</h2>
                
                <h3>CVE-2026-22778: vLLM RCE (CVSS 9.8)</h3>
                <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Orca Security disclosed a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in vLLM, the leading framework for serving large language models. The two-stage exploit combines a heap address leak through PIL error messages with a JPEG2000 video buffer overflow.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> vLLM runs on thousands of GPU clusters worth $10,000-100,000+ each. Default installations ship <em>without authentication</em>, making internet-exposed instances immediately exploitable. Organizations deploying AI infrastructure often prioritize speed over security—exactly the attack surface this CVE exploits.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How to test:</strong> Look for vLLM instances on port 8000, check version disclosure endpoints, and test multimodal API endpoints for error message leaks. Many organizations deploy vLLM temporarily for testing and forget to shut it down.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Read our full analysis:</strong> <a href="/articles/vllm-rce-cve-2026-22778.html">CVE-2026-22778: Critical vLLM RCE Vulnerability</a></p>
                
                <h3>CVE-2026-25049: n8n Workflow Automation (CVSS 9.4)</h3>
                <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Six CVEs disclosed in a single day by Upwind, with CVE-2026-25049 as the crown jewel—a type confusion sandbox escape enabling remote code execution. Additional vulnerabilities included XSS in webhook responses, file read TOCTOU, and credential theft.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> n8n is the open-source automation platform used by enterprises to connect internal systems, APIs, and databases. Compromising n8n means gaining access to credentials for dozens of connected services. The root cause—insufficient permission checks on internal APIs—is a pattern we're seeing across automation platforms.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How to test:</strong> n8n instances typically run on ports 5678 or 443. Test for authentication bypass, webhook injection points, and credential extraction from workflow definitions. Look for exposed /.env files and debug endpoints.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Read our full analysis:</strong> <a href="/articles/n8n-critical-rce-vulnerability-cve-2026-25049.html">CVE-2026-25049: n8n Six-CVE Disclosure</a></p>
                
                <h3>CVE-2026-21532: Azure Functions Information Disclosure (CVSS 8.5)</h3>
                <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Unauthenticated remote access to secrets, configurations, and environment variables in Azure Functions. Microsoft claims it's "fully mitigated" but recommends applying patches—classic cloud provider response.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Serverless functions store everything in environment variables—database connection strings, API keys, third-party tokens. One information disclosure bug can expose credentials enabling lateral movement across an entire cloud environment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How to test:</strong> Enumerate Azure Function URLs (often predictable patterns), test for metadata endpoint exposure, and check for SSRF vulnerabilities that can access the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). Many functions have overly permissive CORS policies enabling cross-origin credential theft.</p>

                <h2>☁️ Cloud Security: AI-Assisted AWS Breach in 10 Minutes</h2>
                
                <p>On February 4, security researchers documented an AI-assisted AWS breach that should terrify every cloud architect. Starting with stolen IAM credentials found in a public S3 bucket, attackers used Claude and Llama models via AWS Bedrock to:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Enumerate permissions</strong> across 19 AWS principals in minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Inject malicious code</strong> into Lambda functions</li>
                    <li><strong>Escalate to admin privileges</strong> through lateral movement</li>
                    <li><strong>Exfiltrate secrets</strong> from Secrets Manager, SSM Parameter Store, and S3</li>
                    <li><strong>Abuse Bedrock models</strong> for GPU resources and reconnaissance</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Total time from initial access to full compromise:</strong> Under 10 minutes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> This wasn't an AWS vulnerability—it was misconfiguration and credential exposure. The attacker left Serbian comments in the code and obvious LLM hallmarks (verbose comments, AI-generated variable names). But the speed of exploitation shows how AI is lowering the skill floor for cloud attacks.</p>
                
                <div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>💡 Bug Hunter Tip:</strong> Public S3 buckets remain the #1 entry point for AWS breaches. Understanding IAM privilege escalation paths is essential. Test for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>S3 bucket enumeration and credential exposure</li>
                        <li>Lambda function environment variables</li>
                        <li>Overly permissive IAM roles attached to EC2/Lambda</li>
                        <li>Secrets Manager access without MFA</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Microsoft February 2026 Patch Tuesday: 61 Vulnerabilities</h3>
                <p>Microsoft's February release patched 61 vulnerabilities across Azure, GitHub, Visual Studio, and enterprise software:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CVE-2026-24300:</strong> Azure Front Door elevation of privilege</li>
                    <li><strong>CVE-2026-21522:</strong> Azure Compute Gallery command injection</li>
                    <li><strong>CVE-2026-23655:</strong> Azure Container Instances secret token exposure</li>
                    <li><strong>CVE-2026-24302:</strong> Azure Arc elevation of privilege</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub Copilot RCE:</strong> Command injection in AI prompts exposing API keys (affects VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Pattern identified:</strong> Serverless and container platforms consistently struggle with secret management. Azure Functions, Container Instances, and Lambda all had information disclosure issues this month.</p>

                <h2>🔧 Framework & Platform CVEs Worth Knowing</h2>
                
                <h3>Django ASGI DoS (CVE-2025-14550)</h3>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Denial-of-service through repeated header concatenation triggering quadratic CPU usage. Attack is trivial—send a request with many duplicate headers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Fixed in:</strong> Django 6.0.2, 5.2.11, 4.2.28</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> DoS vulnerabilities are often overlooked in bug bounty programs, but they're devastating for production systems. The ASGIRequest handler used inefficient string concatenation—a reminder that performance optimizations matter for security too.</p>
                
                <h3>Chainlit AI Framework Data Exposure (CVE-2026-22218, CVE-2026-22219)</h3>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Cloud API keys, AWS credentials, and database connection strings exposed through two separate vulnerabilities: insecure file serving and server-side request forgery (SSRF).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Chainlit is deployed across multiple industries for conversational AI interfaces. Like vLLM and n8n, it's another example of AI infrastructure deployed without adequate security review. Organizations building chatbots and AI interfaces rarely think about backend security.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How to test:</strong> Look for Chainlit instances (typically on port 8000), test file serving endpoints for path traversal (../../.env), and check for SSRF in URL parameters that might access cloud metadata services.</p>
                
                <h3>SAP Commerce Cloud API Exposure (CVE-2026-24321)</h3>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Unauthenticated access to multiple API endpoints exposing private personal information.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> SAP APIs are notoriously complex, making authentication boundary failures common. If you're testing enterprise software, always enumerate API endpoints and test for missing authentication—especially on "internal" APIs that developers assume won't be discovered.</p>

                <h2>📊 Attack Pattern Trends: AI Infrastructure is the New Target</h2>
                
                <p>Analyzing this week's vulnerabilities reveals clear patterns:</p>
                
                <h3>1. Insufficient Input Validation Everywhere</h3>
                <p>vLLM, n8n, Chrome Background Fetch API, Django—all suffered from inadequate input validation. Organizations prioritize feature velocity over security review, especially in "internal" tools that end up exposed to the internet.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Authentication? What Authentication?</h3>
                <p>vLLM ships without authentication. Chainlit exposed APIs without proper auth. SAP APIs had missing authentication checks. Azure Functions leaked credentials without authentication. <strong>Default insecurity remains the industry standard.</strong></p>
                
                <h3>3. Cloud Credential Exposure Enables Lateral Movement</h3>
                <p>S3 misconfigurations, Azure Functions environment variables, Chainlit file serving—cloud credentials are scattered everywhere. Once attackers obtain initial access, lateral movement is trivial through credential reuse.</p>
                
                <h3>4. AI Infrastructure: High Value, Low Security</h3>
                <p>Every major AI infrastructure vulnerability this week (vLLM, Chainlit, Copilot, Bedrock abuse) shares a common theme: organizations deploy AI without hardening. GPU clusters are expensive but poorly secured. LLM servers are exposed without authentication. AI development moves fast; security doesn't.</p>

                <h2>🎯 Recommendations for Bug Hunters</h2>
                
                <p>Based on this week's vulnerabilities and bug bounty trends, here's where to focus your efforts:</p>
                
                <h3>1. Target AI Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>Organizations are deploying vLLM, Ollama, Chainlit, and custom LLM servers faster than they can secure them. Look for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exposed LLM inference servers (ports 8000, 11434, 5000)</li>
                    <li>AI chatbot backends with file upload functionality</li>
                    <li>Prompt injection vulnerabilities in AI-powered features</li>
                    <li>Cloud GPU instances with default credentials</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>2. Test Serverless Functions Aggressively</h3>
                <p>Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Functions all had information disclosure issues this month. Test for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Environment variable exposure</li>
                    <li>Metadata service SSRF (169.254.169.254)</li>
                    <li>Overly permissive CORS policies</li>
                    <li>Function URL enumeration and authorization bypass</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>3. Hunt for Credential Exposure</h3>
                <p>Every major breach this week started with exposed credentials. Check:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Public S3 buckets for IAM credentials and .env files</li>
                    <li>GitHub/GitLab repositories for hardcoded secrets</li>
                    <li>Error messages for API keys and tokens</li>
                    <li>JavaScript files for embedded credentials</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>4. Focus on Authentication Boundary Failures</h3>
                <p>vLLM without authentication, SAP API exposure, n8n internal API access—authentication bypass remains the highest-value vulnerability class. Always test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can unauthenticated users access "internal" APIs?</li>
                    <li>Does authentication default to "open" or "closed"?</li>
                    <li>Are there debug or admin endpoints without proper auth?</li>
                    <li>Can you bypass authentication with missing headers or modified parameters?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion: Speed vs. Security in 2026</h2>
                
                <p>This week's vulnerabilities tell a consistent story: <strong>organizations are deploying infrastructure faster than they can secure it.</strong> AI servers ship without authentication. Serverless functions expose credentials. Workflow automation platforms have insufficient permission checks.</p>
                
                <p>For bug hunters, this creates unprecedented opportunity. The attack surface is exploding—AI infrastructure, serverless platforms, and automation tools are all emerging targets with immature security practices.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The winning strategy for 2026:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Learn cloud security patterns</strong> (IAM privilege escalation, metadata service abuse)</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand AI infrastructure</strong> (LLM servers, vector databases, embedding APIs)</li>
                    <li><strong>Master API security</strong> (authentication bypass, authorization flaws, mass assignment)</li>
                    <li><strong>Hunt for credential exposure</strong> (S3 buckets, environment variables, error messages)</li>
                    <li><strong>Test automation platforms</strong> (n8n, Zapier equivalents, workflow engines)</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Invest in the right tools, read the right books, and focus on emerging technologies before they become mainstream. The organizations deploying cutting-edge infrastructure today will be the ones paying bounties tomorrow.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Stay sharp, stay curious, and happy hunting.</strong></p>
