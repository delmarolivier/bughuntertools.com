**Expected Timeline:**

### Technical Quality Improvements

**Before Today:**

**SEO Score Improvement:** Estimated +30 points (out of 100)

### Expected SEO Impact (Next 30 Days)

**Week 1-2:**

- Social shares show proper preview cards (better CTR)
- Breadcrumbs may appear in search snippets

**Week 3-4:**
- Google Search Console data becomes more reliable
- Possible slight ranking boost from better site structure
- Reduced bounce rate from improved navigation

**Month 2-3:**
- Organic traffic should increase 10-20% (if GSC is verified and indexed)

### Coordination & Team Communication
