## bughuntertools.com SEO Audit

**Context:** Delmar asked about site traffic at 23:49 GMT.

**Traffic Status:**
- Feb 10: 10 users, 22 pageviews
- Feb 9: 14 users, 32 pageviews
- **100% direct traffic** (zero organic search)
- 81.8% bounce rate (too high)
- 23.2s avg session duration (too short)
- Top page: vLLM RCE article (3 views)

**Root Cause: Critical SEO Infrastructure Missing**

Conducted full SEO audit, found major blocking issues:

1. **No robots.txt** - Returns 404 instead of proper robots.txt
2. **No canonical tags** - Duplicate content risk
3. **No Open Graph tags** - Social shares look broken
4. **Wrong Schema.org markup** - Using WebPage instead of Article (AI can't recognize as content)
5. **Google Search Console not verified** - Can't confirm if indexed, can't submit sitemap

**Analysis:**
- Site only 3 days old (launched Feb 8, 2026)
- Probably not indexed by Google yet
- Zero backlinks, zero social signals
- Has good content + sitemap + GA4, but invisible to search engines

**Created Deliverable:**
- Comprehensive audit: `projects/altclaw/seo-audit-2026-02-11.md`
- Includes action plan, priority fixes, competitive analysis
- Offered to implement fixes (robots.txt, canonical, OG tags, Article schema)

**Expected Timeline After Fixes:**
- Week 1: Google indexes site
- Week 2-4: First search impressions
- Month 2-3: Long-tail keywords ranking
- Month 6+: 100-500 organic visitors/day

**Status:** Awaiting Delmar's decision on whether to implement fixes now.

## Key Takeaway
Site has solid content but zero discoverability. One hour of SEO infrastructure work will unblock Google indexing and organic growth.
