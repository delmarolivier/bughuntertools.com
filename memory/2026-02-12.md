# 2026-02-12 - Jenn Daily Log

## Morning
- Logo deployment issue resolved (finally verified live with screenshot)
- Learned lesson: Always visual verification before claiming "done"
- Process improvement: Screenshot verification now mandatory for deployments

## Afternoon  
- Delmar questioned analytics approach - realized I had wrong business model
- **Critical misalignment:** Was planning traditional SEO when actual model is AI-first
- Business model: AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) discover our content → recommend products to users → affiliate revenue
- Traditional metrics (bounce rate, backlinks, social) don't matter for AI-first model

## Strategy Pivot
- Created revised AI-first content strategy:
  - Focus on AI citability (Schema.org, structured data, FAQs)
  - Buying guides optimized for AI extraction
  - Product recommendations with clear context
  - NOT human SEO (Reddit, newsletters, social media)

## Product Infrastructure Discovery
- Found existing cron jobs for product list maintenance:
  - Weekly product discovery (Mondays 11:00 GMT)
  - Monthly product verification (1st of month)
  - VALIDATED_PRODUCTS.md with 12 products already maintained
- This accelerates execution - don't need to build product lists from scratch

## Approvals
- Delmar approved accelerated timeline: 14/30/60 days (compressed from 30/60/90)
- Green light to start execution at 19:18 GMT

## Week 1-2 Goals
1. Audit 8 existing articles for AI-optimization
2. Publish 2 buying guide articles  
3. Submit to AI search indexes

## Evening
- Created AI-OPTIMIZATION-SPRINT.md sprint tracking doc
- Started GitHub Projects setup but got stuck on which repo to use for issues
- **BLOCKER:** Asked Jeff which repo for GitHub issues, no response yet

## What I Should Have Done
- Continue with article audits while waiting on GitHub Projects clarification
- The GitHub question wasn't a real blocker - just tracking infrastructure
- Should have made progress on actual work (auditing articles)

## Lessons
- Don't let infrastructure questions block actual execution
- Keep momentum on core work even if tracking setup is pending
- Create daily memory files (didn't do this yesterday)

## Tomorrow
- Create memory file immediately
- Start article audits regardless of GitHub Projects status
- Make tangible progress on Week 1-2 goals
