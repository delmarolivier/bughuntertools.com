### Inquiry Message

Subject: Affiliate/Referral Partnership Inquiry

Hello Shodan Team,

I run Bug Hunter Tools (https://bughuntertools.com), a comprehensive guide to security testing tools for bug bounty hunters and security researchers.

Shodan is featured prominently in our guide as an essential reconnaissance tool for security professionals. We're receiving increasing traffic from security professionals actively researching tools to purchase.

**Question:** Do you have an affiliate or referral program for content creators/educators?

If so, I'd love to apply. Our audience consists of:
- Bug bounty hunters using Shodan for reconnaissance
- Security researchers conducting vulnerability research
- Penetration testers performing infrastructure assessments

Expected referrals: 5-10 memberships per month within 3-6 months.

If you don't currently have a formal program, would you consider a custom referral arrangement?

Best regards,  
Delmar Olivier
