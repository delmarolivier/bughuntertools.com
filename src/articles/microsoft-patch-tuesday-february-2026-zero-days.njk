                <h2>The 6 Actively Exploited Zero-Days</h2>
                
                <h3>CVE-2026-21510: Windows Shell SmartScreen Bypass (CVSS 8.8)</h3>
                
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Allows attackers to bypass Windows SmartScreen protection, the security feature that warns users about potentially malicious files and websites.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Attack scenario:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Attacker creates malicious link or shortcut (.lnk) file</li>
                    <li>Victim is convinced to open the file (via phishing, malicious download, USB drop)</li>
                    <li>SmartScreen bypass allows payload execution without security warnings</li>
                    <li>Malware installs silently, often ransomware or info-stealers</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> SmartScreen is Windows' primary defense against drive-by downloads and phishing attacks. Bypassing it removes a critical security layer that users depend on to identify threats. This vulnerability affects <strong>all currently supported Windows versions</strong>.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Real-world impact:</strong> Actively exploited by ransomware groups and APT actors to distribute malware through seemingly innocuous downloads.</p>
                
                <h3>CVE-2026-21513: MSHTML Security Feature Bypass (CVSS 8.8)</h3>
                
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Bypasses security features in MSHTML, the legacy rendering engine still present in Windows (even though Edge replaced Internet Explorer).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Attack scenario:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Attacker crafts malicious HTML document or shortcut file</li>
                    <li>User opens the file (email attachment, malicious website, file share)</li>
                    <li>MSHTML renders content and executes attacker-controlled code</li>
                    <li>Security features like Protected Mode or Mark of the Web are bypassed</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Even though Internet Explorer is "retired," the MSHTML engine is deeply embedded in Windows. Many applications (including Outlook, help files, and legacy enterprise software) still use MSHTML for rendering HTML content. This makes the attack surface massive.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Bug bounty perspective:</strong> MSHTML vulnerabilities are valuable findings ($10k-50k+ on Microsoft's bounty program). If you're researching Windows exploitation, MSHTML remains a rich target despite IE's official sunset.</p>
                
                <h3>CVE-2026-21533: Windows RDP Privilege Escalation (CVSS 7.8)</h3>
                
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Allows local authenticated users to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level via Remote Desktop Services.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Attack scenario:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Attacker gains initial access (compromised user account, low-privilege shell)</li>
                    <li>Exploit CVE-2026-21533 to elevate to SYSTEM privileges</li>
                    <li>No user interaction required - fully automated privilege escalation</li>
                    <li>Complete control over the target system achieved</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> RDP is enabled on millions of Windows servers and workstations. Once an attacker has a foothold (even low-privilege access), this vulnerability provides instant escalation to full control. No user interaction required makes this especially dangerous for automated attacks.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Enterprise impact:</strong> In corporate environments where RDP is standard, this vulnerability enables rapid lateral movement. Compromise one user account, escalate to admin, move to domain controllers. Classic APT playbook.</p>
                
                <h3>CVE-2026-21514: Microsoft Word Security Bypass (CVSS 5.5)</h3>
                
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Bypasses Office security features designed to block execution of macros and embedded content from untrusted sources.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Attack scenario:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Attacker creates weaponized Word document with malicious macros</li>
                    <li>User opens document (email attachment, file share)</li>
                    <li>Security bypass allows blocked content to execute despite Protected View</li>
                    <li>Macro payload runs, often dropping additional malware</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Microsoft has spent years hardening Office against macro-based attacks (blocking macros by default, Protected View, etc.). This bypass undermines those protections. Email-based phishing campaigns leveraging this vulnerability are already active in the wild.</p>
                
                <h3>CVE-2026-21525: Windows Remote Access Connection Manager DoS (CVSS 6.2)</h3>
                
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Allows unauthenticated attackers to crash the Remote Access Connection Manager service or entire system.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Attack scenario:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Attacker sends crafted network packets to target system</li>
                    <li>No authentication required - fully remote attack</li>
                    <li>Service or system crashes, disrupting availability</li>
                    <li>Repeated exploitation can cause persistent denial of service</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> While "only" a DoS vulnerability (not RCE or privilege escalation), unauthenticated remote DoS attacks are valuable for disruption campaigns, extortion, or covering tracks during other attacks. Being actively exploited suggests it's part of broader attack campaigns.</p>
                
                <h3>CVE-2026-21511: Microsoft Outlook Spoofing (CVSS 7.5)</h3>
                
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Allows attackers to spoof email headers and bypass Outlook's security warnings through crafted emails.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Attack scenario:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Attacker crafts email with spoofed sender information</li>
                    <li>Email appears to come from trusted source (CEO, IT department, partner organization)</li>
                    <li>Victim trusts spoofed identity and follows malicious instructions</li>
                    <li>Leads to credential theft, wire fraud, or malware installation</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Exploitable via the preview pane means victims don't even need to open the email. Simply viewing it in the preview pane triggers the vulnerability. This dramatically lowers the bar for successful exploitation in phishing campaigns.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Business email compromise (BEC) impact:</strong> Spoofing vulnerabilities are gold for BEC attackers conducting wire fraud and CEO fraud schemes. Expect this to be heavily exploited in financial fraud campaigns.</p>

                    <p><strong>🎯 Research Tip:</strong> Microsoft patches come out monthly. Within 24-48 hours of Patch Tuesday, analyze patches using binary diffing tools (BinDiff, Diaphora) to understand the vulnerability. Then hunt for similar patterns in unpatched components. This technique (patch gapping) has yielded numerous high-value findings.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why should I patch immediately instead of waiting for my normal maintenance window?</h3>
        <p>Six of these vulnerabilities are actively exploited in the wild RIGHT NOW. Attackers have working exploits and are using them against unpatched systems. Every day you wait increases risk of compromise. Patch Tuesday exploits typically see mass exploitation within 24-72 hours of patch release as attackers reverse-engineer the fixes. This isn't theoretical - ransomware groups and APTs are hitting vulnerable systems today.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How are these zero-days being exploited in the real world?</h3>
        <p>CVE-2026-21510/21513 (SmartScreen/MSHTML bypasses) via phishing emails with malicious attachments. CVE-2026-21533 (RDP privilege escalation) by attackers who gained initial access. CVE-2026-21514/21525 (NTLM hash disclosure, DWM) for credential theft and persistence. Attack chain: Phishing → bypass SmartScreen → execute payload → escalate privileges → steal credentials → lateral movement. This is active, organized exploitation - not opportunistic scanning.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Which of the 6 zero-days is most dangerous?</h3>
        <p>CVE-2026-21510 (SmartScreen bypass, CVSS 8.8) is the most impactful because it breaks Windows' primary defense against malicious downloads. Anyone can be targeted via email/web with no prior access needed. CVE-2026-21513 (MSHTML) is close second due to massive attack surface. Both are user interaction exploits but require minimal social engineering. The RDP escalation (CVE-2026-21533) is critical for attackers who already have access.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I safely test for these vulnerabilities in my bug bounty lab?</h3>
        <p>Yes, with proper precautions. Set up isolated Windows VMs (unpatched, Feb 2026), test SmartScreen/MSHTML bypasses with crafted files, practice RDP privilege escalation locally. NEVER test on production systems or systems you don't own. Document your findings, create PoC videos. If you find similar bugs in other products, report responsibly. Public PoCs exist for some of these - study them in isolated environments only.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I'm running the latest Windows 11 - do I still need to patch?</h3>
        <p>YES. Windows 11 is affected by all 6 actively exploited zero-days. "Latest version" without February 2026 patches = vulnerable. Microsoft doesn't automatically install patches immediately - check Windows Update manually. Verify patch installation: Settings → Windows Update → Update History → look for KB articles from February 11, 2026. Don't assume you're protected just because you're on Windows 11.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the typical bug bounty payout for vulnerabilities like these?</h3>
        <p>Microsoft's bounty program pays $10,000-$250,000 for critical vulnerabilities. SmartScreen bypass: $15k-30k. MSHTML security feature bypass: $10k-50k. RDP privilege escalation: $15k-40k. NTLM hash disclosure: $10k-25k. Zero-days with confirmed exploitation pay premium. But you can't report these specific CVEs now (already patched) - find NEW similar vulnerabilities in Windows components.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do attackers chain multiple Patch Tuesday vulnerabilities together?</h3>
        <p>Common chain: CVE-2026-21510 (SmartScreen bypass) for initial access → CVE-2026-21533 (RDP escalation) for SYSTEM privileges → CVE-2026-21514 (NTLM disclosure) for credential theft → lateral movement to domain controllers. Single vulnerability = foothold. Multiple vulnerabilities = full domain compromise. This is why comprehensive patching matters - attackers combine exploits for maximum impact. Defense in depth only works if all layers are patched.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What tools should I use to test for Patch Tuesday vulnerabilities?</h3>
        <p>Metasploit (check for modules targeting these CVEs), Nessus/OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning, Windows Exploit Suggester (PowerShell tool), Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, custom PoC scripts (study public exploits on GitHub). For bug hunting: Burp Suite for web-based bypasses, WinDbg for debugging, Process Monitor for behavior analysis. Practice on vulnerable VMs before attempting real bug bounty research.</p>
