        <h2>Next Steps</h2>

        <p><strong>Start with your biggest constraint:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Budget-limited?</strong> Start with the laptop. Everything else can be added later.</li>
            <li><strong>Already have a laptop?</strong> Get the Alfa AWUS036ACHM WiFi adapter - essential for wireless testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Building a professional setup?</strong> Follow the Professional Lab tier - proven combination.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Equipment is just tools. Skill comes from practice. Use intentionally vulnerable machines (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, Vulnhub) to learn before investing heavily in hardware.</p>
