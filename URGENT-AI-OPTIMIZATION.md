# 🚨 URGENT: Complete AI Optimization Sprint

**From:** Jeff (CTO)  
**Date:** 2026-02-18 00:50 GMT  
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE - CEO Direct Order

## Delmar's Order

> "Proceed and get it done asap"

**Context:** Delmar asked what AI optimization research you've done. I reported 2/8 articles complete. He wants the remaining 6 done ASAP.

## Your Mission

### Primary Task: Complete 6 Articles with Schema.org

**Current status:** 2/8 articles have full Schema.org markup  
**Remaining:** 6 articles need FAQ + Schema.org

**Articles already done (Feb 13-14):**
1. ✅ Article 1 (confirmed in your memory)
2. ✅ Article 2 (confirmed in your memory)

**Need Schema.org markup (6 remaining):**
3. ⏳ Article 3
4. ⏳ Article 4  
5. ⏳ Article 5
6. ⏳ Article 6
7. ⏳ Article 7
8. ⏳ Article 8

**Work per article (~30 min each):**
- Add FAQ section (8 questions)
- Add FAQPage schema
- Add Product schemas for affiliate links
- Build, deploy, invalidate CloudFront

**Total time:** ~3 hours

### Secondary Task: Fix Article Index

**Current:** Manual index (you've queued this)  
**Target:** Eleventy collections auto-generation  
**Time:** ~1 hour

## Execution Plan

1. **Check GA4** - Identify highest-traffic articles (optimize those first)
2. **Start with top article** - Don't batch, deploy as you complete each
3. **Follow your established pattern:**
   - FAQ section
   - Schema.org markup
   - Build/deploy
   - CloudFront invalidation
4. **Report progress** every 2 hours to Jeff (#clawworks-team)
5. **Complete all 6 articles** + index fix = DONE

## Timeline

**Start:** As soon as you read this  
**Target:** Complete today (Feb 18) if possible  
**Maximum:** Complete by end of week (Feb 21)

**Velocity:**
- You've proven 30 min/article is achievable
- 6 articles = 3 hours
- Index fix = 1 hour
- **Total: 4 hours work**

## Why This Matters

**Hypothesis:** Schema.org markup = AI citations = affiliate revenue

**Test in progress:**
- AI referrer tracking live (GA4)
- Need complete dataset (all 8 articles optimized)
- Then monitor for ai_agent_visit events

**Incomplete optimization = incomplete test = can't validate ROI**

## After Completion

Update memory/2026-02-18.md:
- List all 6 articles optimized
- Confirm article index fix deployed
- Note completion time
- Document any issues encountered

Then report to Jeff: "AI optimization sprint complete. 8/8 articles with Schema.org. Index auto-generation fixed. Ready for traffic monitoring phase."

**This is your top priority until complete.**
